        <h2>WEATHER APPLICATION</h2><br>
        <h3>Developed a user-friendly weather application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br>
            Integrated weather API for real-time location-based forecasts.<br>
            Implemented user interface features for quick access to current conditions and user-friendly platform.<br>
            Ensured offline and deployed in GitHub for the functionality and continued basic weather information access.
            </h3>

            <h2>CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION SYSTEM</h2><br>
            <h3>Built a credit card fraud detection system to stop fraudulent transactions and protect financial data.<br>
                This System uses real-time analysis and machine learning to identify suspicious activity with high accuracy.<br>
                Worked on user-friendly interface for managing potential fraud cases, reducing manual work and improving efficiency.<br>
                Designed with a scalable architecture to handle future growth in transaction volume, ensuring continued protection.<br>
                System provides real-time alerts to financial institutions for faster intervention and potential fraud prevention.<br>
                </h3>

                <br>
                <h2>KIDNEY TUMOR DETECTION</h2><br>
                <h3>The proposed system aims to enhance kidney cancer diagnosis using a combination of machine learning and deep learning techniques applied to CT images.<br>
                     For classification, it utilizes advanced CNN models such as ResNet101, DenseNet121, Xception, and NasNetMobile, alongside an ensemble model that <br>
                     combines Xception and NasNetMobile to improve diagnostic accuracy by leveraging complementary features.<br>
                     I have contributed in creating ML models and frontend development.
